# StringMethod.jl
Julia implementation of the String Method for computing transition paths and saddle points on energy landscapes

This currently only implements the simplified string method as developed in E, Ren, and Vanden-Eijnden (2007).

# TO DO
* Update documentation
* Provide examples
* Add additional methods
